## ðŸŽ“ About Me

I was a undergraduated student at Harbin Institute of Technology, School of Physics, with a strong background in AI engineering and research. My research focuses on mlsys(model inference optimaztion, model compression) and deep learning for science. I was also a visiting student at the University of California, San Diego, where I studied computer science and physics.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working as an Algorithm Researcher at AMD Quark Group
- ðŸŒ± I'm exploring model compression methods such as quantization and applications in heterogeneous computing
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm collaborating with SD-HC to develop heterogeneous computing frameworks
